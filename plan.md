# Reinforcement Learning 
## **Objectives**
- Understand the core concepts of Reinforcement Learning 
- (Optional) Model a problem into a trainable environment for reinforcement learning    
- Apply reinforcement learning on a specific environment (hopefully algoritma task scheduling)
___
## **Timeline**

### 1. Exploration 
- [ ] Find good environment such as Job Shop Scheduling or its alternatives task to be solved. 
- [ ] Find related and current works regarding selected task or its alternatives to meet SOTA RL model if possible


Output : 
- [ ] Task + Algorithm + Performance Metric + Deployment scheme + list of techs & depencencies 



### 2. Implementation 
- [ ] Implement Environment 
- [ ] Implement Agent
- [ ] Implement Objective Function
- [ ] Implement RL Model Algorithm
- [ ] Hypermarameter Tuning
- [ ] Make it run and eat some snack 
- [ ] (Optional) Compare the result with other method
